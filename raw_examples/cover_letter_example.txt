Header: Head of Business Operations Role - CV
Body:

Hey team,

I'm Guy :) 

I built business operations at Firebolt from zero, from forecasting and board reporting to cross-functional programs, PLG motion and AI automation from the ground up (LangChain and then AWS Bedrock).
Now I want to do it for Impala. I understand your space, have built these systems before, and possess technical depth most BizOps people lack. 

Will love to chat, CV attached.

Thanks,
Guy
